### Calendae Working Agreement

1. Working Through Disagreements:
   a. To work through disagreements we will talk through the opposing sides and come to the most logical solution that the majority agrees on.
  
2. When We’ll Work 
   a. We’re going to be honest with each other about our abilities and other life commitments when scheduling project work time. But we’ll try to reach out to each other at least once a day to make sure the work is getting done.

3. How We’ll Make Sure We’re All Included 
   a. Make sure we all are committing at a similar pace and the work is split up fairly.
